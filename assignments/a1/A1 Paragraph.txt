/* My implementation of these graphical shapes showcases a scene with
    headphones playing music in a chaotic background. To me, music acts 
    as a universal remedy for anything in my life. The blue headphones playing music 
    contrasts with the red background showcasing a sign of peace within chaos. This is
    accentuated by the several red shapes in the background moving all over the place. 
    The slower rhythm of the headphones "playing" music with the animated circles also
    aims to create a sense of tranquility, which is how I perceive listening to music. 
    The how for the moving shapes is utilizing sin and tan as well as iTime to 
    keep the shapes constantly in motion. The other shapes are implemented using
    techniques found in steps 1-4. I made sure to divide the "parts" of the image
    into sections so I can easily reference parts of the image. */
